Now that we´ve learned about variables and data types, let´s get some practice.
-Define a variable named city and set it equal to any string
-Define a variable named price and set it equal to any float
-Define a variable named high_score and set it equal to any int
-Define a variable named is_having_fun and set it to a Boolean value
You do not need to print them out, but can if you want.
