'''
Get some practice with escape sequences! No need to create new variables,
just use the existing variables we have created for you and follow the instructions.

# Set the message variable equal to any string containing a new-line escape sequence
message = "Hello\nthere"
print(message)

# Add a string to the mountains variable that when printed results in: /\/\/\
# You will need to use an escape sequence more than once!
mountains = "/\\/\\/\\"
print(mountains)

# Set the quotation variable to any string that contains an escaped double quotation mark

quotation = "He said \"What happend\""
print(quotation)
